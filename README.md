Hello my name is Saathvik Valvekar, and I am the creator of MoneyGuru, your go-to financial literacy app designed specifically for K-12! My app teaches teens with essential skills in budgeting, saving, and managing money effectively. Unlike other financial literacy apps, MoneyGuru uses interactive tutorials with characters and short stories for visual and oral learners, and for learners who consume information better by reading, MoneyGuru has reading materials that break down complex concepts into simple, easy-to-understand lessons coupled with quizzes.
